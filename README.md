# My Web App

This project demonstrates a modern DevOps workflow: containerized with Docker, orchestrated with Kubernetes, and automated via GitHub Actions CI/CD.

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm ci
   ```
2. Run the app:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   (Or open `index.html` directly if this is a static site.)

## Docker

Build and run the Docker container:
```sh
docker build -t my-web-app .
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-web-app
```

## Kubernetes

1. Make sure your Docker image is pushed to a registry.
2. Apply the manifests:
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```
3. Access the app via the configured Ingress.

## CI/CD Pipeline

- Automated via GitHub Actions:
  - Runs tests and linting
  - Builds and pushes Docker image
  - Deploys to Kubernetes
  - Runs smoke tests
  - Performs security scanning
